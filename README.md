- [x] BS-Objaverse Dataset cart launched on huggingface.
- [x] MV-LLaVA model and web demo.
- [x] Paper and project page.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

## MV-LLaVA

### üìú News
MV-LLaVA is trained on 30K GPT-4V generated instructive conversation pairs, enable LLaVA to process multi-view images rendered from 3D content, chat about it and generate dense descriptive captions or provide quality estimation.

It's 7B model is available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Zery/MV-LLaVA-7B)

We use this model to provide quality estimation on Objaverse and rewrite dense descriptive captions, We call this caption dataset BS-Objaverse(**B**oot**S**trap-Objaverse), it is now available on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zery/BS-Objaverse).

We also use this model to process synthetic multi-view images generated by [SV3D](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sv3d) and [Zero123++](https://github.com/SUDO-AI-3D/zero123plus), It's full version of 1M high quality multi-view images will be made publicly available soon.

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage
#### Installation (Infer only)
Our MV-LLaVA is based on [ShareGPT-4V](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main/projects/ShareGPT4V), thanks for their awesome work!
You can clone our repo and `cd MV_LLaVA && pip install -e .` to install `share4v` package.

- launch our demo through `python app.py`
- batch inference your multi-view images using batch scripts in `tools/`

#### Installation (Training)

**training demo**
clone our repo and `cd MV_LLaVA && pip install -e .` to install `share4v` package.
first use `bash scripts/slurm_pretrain_7b_mv.sh` to align CLIP with LLama, than run `bash scripts/slrum_finetune_7b_mv.sh` to do instruct tuning.

we have uploaded a demo objaverse multi-view data (10 images only) in `data/obj_demo`, its json for pretraining and instruct tuning are available in `data/demo_obj_pretrain.json` and  `data/demo_obj_instruct.json`. You can generate your own data following the same format. It's worth noticing that pretraining data only support single-turn conversation.

You can overlook the modification [here](https://github.com/SunzeY/Bootstrap3D/commit/0a3d99de63d0d8fa323b0336f40487cbd104b33d) to MV-LLaVA's modification based on Share4V. During your own special usage, you only need to focus on these lines of code.

If you only need to change training data, you can focus on line of codes with `modify` tag (search this tag in your IDE).

**full data preparation (Objaverse)**
1. download full [cap3D dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiange/Cap3D) of objaverse rendered images.
2. download BS-Objaverse dataset GPT-4V generated annotations [obj_descript_gpt_10k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zery/BS-Objaverse), convert its into the similar format as demo did.
3. prepare [share4v dataset](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main/projects/ShareGPT4V) (optional to mitigate overfitting)
