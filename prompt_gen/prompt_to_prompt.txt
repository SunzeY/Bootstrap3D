Please help us to create a set of text prompts for text to 3D generation. Now, I will give you some more tips and requirements for the prompt creation. First, we will decide the complexity and creativity:
1. Complexity:
- Structure Complexity: Simplicity or intricacy of the objectâ€™s design
- Number of Elements: Single or multiple subjects
- Relationships: Interactions and relations between multiple objects
- Environmental Complexity: Simplicity or intricacy of the scene and surroundings
- Detail Level: From simple shapes to complex structures with fine details
2. Creativity:
- Novelty: Common, everyday items to unique, imaginative creations
- Conceptual Innovation: Degree of abstract or unconventional thinking required
- Emotional Impact: Potential to evoke emotions or thoughts
- Storytelling: Inclusion of elements that suggest a backstory or narrative
